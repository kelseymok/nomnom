## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180C and place a wire rack in the middle of the oven.
2. Butter the base of a 25cm springform pan
3. Place the Lebnitz vollkorn biscuits in a food processor and pulse until fine crumbles
4. Melt 85g butter in a medium pan. Stir in the digestive biscuit crumbs until evenly moist
5. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.
6. For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 220C
7. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat Topfen/Quark at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.
8. With the mixer on low, gradually add sugar, flour, a pinch of salt
9. Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Adding vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Whisk in 3 large eggs and 1 yolk, one at a time.
10. Stir in sour cream. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy (don't overbeat).
11. Boil about 700ml water in a kettle or on the stove.
12. Smear butter on the sides of the baking tin. Pour in the filling (sink any lumps). Place on rack on oven and pour boiling water in the baking sheet (under the rack) in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes.
13. Reduce oven temperature to 110C and bake for 45 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble.
14. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.

### Sour Cream Topping
1. Mix together sour cream, sugar, and lemon juice. Spread over cheesecake right to the edges. Cover with foil and chill overnight.

### Berry Topping
1. In a saucepan, add the berries, sugar, and lemon juice. Reduce to a sauce. Let cool to room temperature and pour over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover with foil and chill overnight.

### Serving
Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, and cut a slice.

## Troubleshooting
* My dough won't stretch to the edges and keeps bouncing back. During the dough-making process, we create a strong gluten network. Sometimes dough needs a bit more time to relax. Put a towel over your dough to keep it from drying out and let it relax for a little more time. I normally let my dough rest for 30 min to an hour (best to forget about it for a while).

## Instructions
Start the levain for the **Pita Bread**:
1. Mix the yeast (5g), sugar (2g), and water (120ml) in a bowl until sugar is dissolved
2. Add flour (45g) and whisk until chunks have gone away
3. Let rest for 30 minutes (set a timer!)

Prepare chickpeas and garlic for **Hummus**:
1. Fill a sauce pan with hummus (1 can), water to cover, and baking soda (1/2 tsp)
2. Let boil for 20 minutes (set a timer!)
3. Finely slice a garlic clove and place at the bottom of a food processor and add lemon juice (1/4 cup, 80ml) and salt (1/2 tsp). Let rest.

Prepare the **Pickled Onions**:
1. Peel an onion and cut lengthwise
2. Thinly slice into half-circle shapes
3. In a pot, measure out 30ml sugar (NOTE in volume), 60ml apple cider vinegar, 90ml water. Optinoally add some dried herbs or whole peppercorns. 
4. Bring to a boil (ensure sugar has dissolved)
5. Place sliced onions into a jar
6. Pour liquid into jar over onions
7. Cover with lid and let rest

Mix the dough for the **Pita Bread**:
1. In the bowl of levain, mix salt (5g), flour (150g), and olive oil (14g)
2. Knead until smooth
3. Cover and set aside in a warm place for an hour (set a timer!)

Prepare the **Hummus**:
1. Add tahini (1/2 cup) to food processor (that has the garic and lemon juice in it)
2. Blend until thick and creamy
3. Drizzle in 2-4 tbsp cold water until super smooth and creamy
4. Add cumin (1/2 tsp) and other spices as desired (e.g. chili powder, paprika)
5. Drizzle in olive oil (2 tbsp)
6. Pour into bowl or jar and set aside

Prepare the **Salad**:

3. Finely chop one bunch of parsley and add to bowl
4. Crumble feta into bowl
5. Juice 1 lemon and add to bowl

Prepare the **Halloumi**:
1. Slice Halloumi into 1 cm slices
2. In a heated non-stick skillet (med), add a little oil. Once hot, place sliced halloumi.
3. Flip halloumi once one side is golden brown.

Prepare the **Pita Bread**:
1. Separate the dough into 4 parts
2. Set your stainless steel or cast iron pan on the stove and turn on. We want this to be hot but not enough to cause damage.
3. With a rolling pin, roll 1 ball into thin but NOT super thin circles
4. Place on a hot pan. It should almost immediately bubble. If not, the pan wasn't hot enough. It should take about 1-2 minutes.
5. Roll out the second circle
6. Flip the pita bread on the stove. After 1 minute, remove and place on a plate. Cover with a dish towel.
7. Repeat 4-6 until you run out of pita breads
8. Serve immediately
